## Chapter 1 : Introduction to Deep Learning in Java

We will discuss about DL4J as a distinct deep learning solution and the significance of Java deep learning library. We will also showcase required deep learning concepts in a recipe-based approach.

In this chapter, we have the following recipes:

 - [Determine the right network type to solve the problem](https://github.com/rahul-raj/Java-Deep-Learning-Cookbook/tree/master/01_Introduction_to_Deep_Learning_in_Java/01_Determine_the_right_network_type_to_solve_the_problem "Determine the right network type to solve the problem")
