#### Instructions 
Navigate to **sourceCode** directory and you will see two directories:

 - cookbookapp
 - spring-dl4j
 
&nbsp;

For complete implementation on customer churn prediction, import the maven project: **cookbookapp**. For DL4J Spring integration example, import the maven project:
**spring-dl4j** 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

You may use the dataset (*dataset.zip*) included in this directory or use on your own by following the instructions in cookbook.
