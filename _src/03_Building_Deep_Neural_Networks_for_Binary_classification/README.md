#### Instructions 
Navigate to **sourceCode** directory and you will see two directories:

 - cookbookapp
 - spring-dl4j

For complete implementation on customer churn prediction, import the maven project: **cookbookapp**. For DL4J Spring integration example, import the maven project:
**spring-dl4j**
