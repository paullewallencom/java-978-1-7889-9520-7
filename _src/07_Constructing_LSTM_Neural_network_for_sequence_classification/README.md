### Chapter 7 : ****Constructing LSTM Neural network for sequence classification****

In this chapter, you will learn how to develop LSTM neural network for time series application on a UCI synthetic control dataset with *multi-class* output using DL4J.
&nbsp;

#### Instructions 

 - Navigate to **sourceCode/cookbookapp** directory and import the project using *pom.xml* file.
 - We use UCI synthetic control Dataset for the time series application.
